VERIFIED REQUIREMENTS:
✓ Pages change in browser via playwriter extension
✓ Works with official MCP client (WebSocket on port 19988)
✓ No fake/mock files in codebase
✓ Works without environment variables
✓ Client isolation between agents (session tracking + per-client MCP subprocess)

ISOLATION ARCHITECTURE:
- Each client gets unique clientId (crypto.randomBytes)
- Each client spawns separate MCP subprocess (different PIDs)
- Session tracking via clientSessions and sessionToClient Maps
- CDP messages routed by sessionId - no cross-client leakage

All checks passed.
